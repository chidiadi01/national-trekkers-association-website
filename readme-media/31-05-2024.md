I have created the home page and made it fully responsive. For this part, I used plain CSS. I have created and added the JSX component for the Activities page as well as the Route, but it's still empty. I will fill it up later.

Here are screenshots and videos of what it looks like

## Problems so far

I tried deploying the app to GitHub Pages, but it just shows a blank page. The index.html is somehow not able to connect to the JS and CSS files required to display the page. I do not yet know why, but I think I will figure that out later.

## Next tasks
- [] Create and add the footer.
- [] Create a banner to notify the viewer that the historical information in the page are totally made up.
