**1st June, 2024**

I created the footer and added it to the Activities page and Legacies page. I, however, have not finished with the integration.


## Problems so far

I do not really have any problems. I am just thinking of how to make sure that for the footer, the link in the site map colours orange for the page you are in. I am still thinking of how to make that work.

## Next tasks
- [x] Create and add the footer.
- [ ] Create a banner to notify the viewer that the historical information in the page are totally made up.
- [ ] Integrate footer with remaining pages.
- [ ] Make the link for the current page to be orange.
