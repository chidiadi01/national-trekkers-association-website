# Project Idea

This website is meant to serve as a way to practice and showcase my skills in web development. More about it will be written later.

## Project Description
The project is a website for a fictional organization known as National Trekkers' Association. It tells what they do, displays the activites, people's track records and allows people to signup online, and log into their accounts. 

## Objectives of the project

In this project, I aim to incorporate things like:

- [x] Use the React Router
- [ ] Use Redux
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Integrate Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Integrate Bootstrap
- [ ] Integrate the app with an API and parse data from it
- [ ] Integrate CI/CD

## What has been done so far

[**31st May, 2024**](/readme-media/31-05-2024.md)

I have created the home page and made it fully responsive. For this part, I used plain CSS. I have created and added the JSX component for the Activities page as well as the Route, but it's still empty. I will fill it up later.

Here are screenshots and videos of what it looks like
